## Building a Library of Prompts: 
Instead of relying on AI to do everything, the approach involves building a library of prompts that help you execute business tasks well.
## Learning and Building Simultaneously: 
This method allows you to learn essential skills while actively building your business, rather than spending extensive time learning beforehand.

## Writing Content:
- Create a prompt for a personal brand strategy by finding a YouTube video on the topic and turning its instructions into a prompt
- Create a prompt for content ideas by feeding AI 10 high-performing content pieces and asking it to teach you how to replicate them .
- Create a prompt for newsletters by pasting 2-3 newsletters you like and having AI break down their structure .

## Recommendation: 
Consider creating prompts that guide or coach you through the writing process rather than having AI write for you directly.

## Building a Digital Product:
- Have a product idea you want to build .
- Ask AI how similar products are structured and how to build them to ensure user benefit.
- Create a prompt that guides you through the product creation process section by section, using the instructions from the previous point.

## Offer Creation:
- Create a customer avatar prompt as discussed earlier in the video.
- Create a prompt that guides you through creating a compelling offer blueprint.
- Ask AI how Alex Hormozi creates offers for the instructions portion.
- Use the offer blueprint for other marketing materials and feed it to AI when providing product information.
  
## Copywriting:
- Find a respected copywriting book (e.g., Breakthrough Advertising or Great Leads), upload its PDF to AI, and ask it to create a detailed actionable guide.
- Find a landing page structure or other promotion type (email, social) you want to emulate, paste it into AI, and have it explain why it works.
- Combine the structure breakdown and copywriting guide into a prompt that interviews you for your offer, customer avatar, and other context to write the copy.
